# web-scraping-challenge

## Note: If an error occurs refresh the page and it should work

Built a web application to scrap multiple websites for Mars data and display the information using `html`.

Used a `Jupyter Notebook` to do the initial analysis to test the scrape code with `BeautifulSoup` and `Requests/Splinter`.

Once the code was working in the `Jupyter Notebook` copied this to the `scrape.py` file and created the file `app.py` to read the route and load the data to Mongo Database. Finally, an `index.html ` file was created to display the elements.
